# Queue Manager for Bull

If you use Bull, you've probably run into a situation in which the number of connections to your redis server
skyrocketed. Why? Because each instance of your queues created 3 connections and each instance of your application
created each queue. Easily racking up thousands of connection. 

Enter the Queue Manager. At least now you can limit the number of connections a single instance makes!
